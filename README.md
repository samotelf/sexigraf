SexiGraf is a fully open-source vSphere centric Graphite VMware appliance with a Grafana frontend. It pulls VI and VSAN metrics from VMware vCenter APIs, push them to Graphite and let Grafana produces the gorgeous dashboards we love so much!

*Official website for this awesome appliance is available at http://www.sexigraf.fr*

## VMware VSAN

The metrics used in the various VSAN dashboards are collected every minutes using to the `QueryVsanStatistics` API method of `HostVsanInternalSystem`. With some json ticks, it is possible to access any metrics from the VSAN cluster. And guess what! We’re already working on other cool SexiPanels for VSAN: http://www.sexigraf.fr/vsan-sexipanels/

## VMware vSphere

Fast. Very fast. That’s what we had in mind when we designed SexiGraf. When you need vSphere metrics, the obvious way is the `PerformanceManager`, but we need something faster so we choosed managed object properties and quickstats like `ResourcePoolQuickStats`. If we have no other choice, we failback to the `PerformanceManager` but we only query the last 15 samples of the `RealTime samplingPeriod` since we pull vSphere metrics every 5 minutes. http://www.sexigraf.fr/vsphere-sexipanels/  

## FreeNAS

Starting from version 9.10, FreeNAS allows users to set a “Remote Graphite Server” target to send all the metrics harvested by Collectd. Guess what would make a nice Graphite target! http://www.sexigraf.fr/freenas-sexipanel/

## Windows

Leveraging the built-in Graphite listener of SexiGraf, we introduced Windows support in version 0.99c with basic cpu-ram-hdd metrics : http://www.sexigraf.fr/windows-sexipanel/
